    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> My name is Anastassje Santiago, though I go by Chia. I have never taken a computer science class before, I am taking it to fulfill my math requirement so I can continue to finish my degree at University of Oregon. I am very grateful I got to take this class, this is definitely different from your average math class. I truly enjoyed learning the code, though I am still very shakey with Javascript. I feel very confident in HTML and CSS, and would like to continue my knowledge in classes. I have defintiely struggled during the end of this term due to Javascript. Though, I'm glad to learn such a difficult language. Now I am going to offer my knowledge to give a helping hand to my parent's business website.
